# React Select

## Problem Statement

Create a select/dropdown component. The problem is purposefully nebulous and you must decide what interactions it should contain.

## Requirements

- [x] Show a selected value
- [x] Open to select a new value
- [x] Selecting a new value closes the dropdown

### My Requirements

- [x] Keyboard interactions
  - [x] Down arrow opens select
  - [x] Up/down navigation of items
  - [x] Navigated items can be selected (via Enter or space keys)
  - [x] Tabbing closes select and moves focus to the next tab stop
- [x] Mousing over an item will cause it to be selected when enter/space key is pressed
