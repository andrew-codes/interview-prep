# React Select

## Problem Statement

Create a select/dropdown component. The problem is purposefully nebulous and you must decide what interactions it should contain.

## Requirements

- [ ] Show a selected value
- [ ] Open to select a new value
- [ ] Selecting a new value closes the dropdown

### My Requirements

- [ ] Keyboard interactions
  - [ ] Down arrow opens select
  - [ ] Up/down navigation of items
  - [ ] Navigated items can be selected (via Enter or space keys)
  - [ ] Tabbing closes select and moves focus to the next tab stop
- [ ] Mousing over an item will cause it to be selected when enter/space key is pressed
